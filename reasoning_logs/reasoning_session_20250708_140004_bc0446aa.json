    "final_answer": "## WHAT: Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem asks us to find all critical points of the function f(x) = x³ - 3x² + 2x.  Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is either zero or undefined.\n\n## HOW: Solution Process\n\n1. **Differentiation:** Calculate the first derivative of f(x) using the power rule:\n   f'(x) = 3x² - 6x + 2\n\n2. **Finding Critical Points:** Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n   3x² - 6x + 2 = 0\n\n3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**  We can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n   x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n   where a = 3, b = -6, and c = 2.\n   x = (6 ± √(36 - 24)) / 6\n   x = (6 ± √12) / 6\n   x = (6 ± 2√3) / 6\n   x = 1 ± (√3)/3\n\n4. **Checking for Undefined Derivative:** The derivative f'(x) = 3x² - 6x + 2 is a polynomial and is defined for all real numbers. Therefore, there are no critical points where the derivative is undefined.\n\n## WHY: Justification\n\n* **Power Rule:** The power rule of differentiation, d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1), is a fundamental principle of calculus, derived from the definition of the derivative.\n* **Quadratic Formula:** The quadratic formula provides a guaranteed solution to any quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0.\n* **Definition of Critical Points:** Critical points are defined as points where the derivative is zero or undefined. This definition is based on the concept of local extrema and points of inflection in calculus.\n\n## WHEN: Applicability\n\nThis solution applies whenever we are dealing with a differentiable function and need to find its critical points. The method used here, involving the power rule and the quadratic formula, is applicable to polynomial functions.\n\n## WHERE: Validity\n\nThis solution is valid within the realm of real numbers.  If we were considering complex numbers, the concept of critical points might need to be re-evaluated.  Furthermore, the specific techniques used here are most directly applicable to polynomial functions.  Other functions might require different differentiation techniques.\n\n## WHO: Entities\n\n* **Function f(x):** The object of study.\n* **Derivative f'(x):** Used to find critical points.\n* **Variable x:** Represents the independent variable of the function.\n* **Mathematical Foundation Expert:** Provides the theoretical basis for differentiation and solving quadratic equations.\n* **Boundary Reasoning Expert:** Helps identify the critical points as boundaries between increasing and decreasing behavior.\n\n## WHICH: Alternatives\n\nAlternative approaches to finding the roots of the quadratic could include factoring or completing the square. However, the quadratic formula is a general method that always works, making it a robust choice.  Numerical methods could also be used to approximate the solutions, but the quadratic formula provides exact solutions.\n\n## HIDDEN INSIGHTS\n\nThe presence of the square root of 3 in the solution suggests a connection to the geometry of equilateral triangles or other structures with inherent three-fold symmetry. This might hint at deeper connections between the function's behavior and underlying geometric principles, although this is speculative.\n\n## FINAL ANSWER\n\nThe critical points of f(x) = x³ - 3x² + 2x are x = 1 + (√3)/3 and x = 1 - (√3)/3.
