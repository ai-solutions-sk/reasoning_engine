    "final_answer": "## WHAT: Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the color of Alice, Bob, and Carla's hats, given that each person has either a red or blue hat, they can see the other two hats but not their own, at least one hat is red, and they each make a statement about their knowledge of their own hat's color in turn. We need to reconstruct Carla's reasoning to understand how she deduced her hat's color.\n\n## HOW: Solution Process\n\n**Step 1: Problem Formulation and Constraint Identification (WHAT)**\n\nWe are given the following constraints:\n* Each person has either a red or blue hat.\n* Each person can see the other two hats but not their own.\n* At least one hat is red.\n* Alice and Bob both state \"I don't know.\"\n* Carla states \"I know my hat is red.\"\n\n**Step 2: Applying Negative Reasoning (HOW)**\n\nWe start by considering what each person *cannot* know based on the information available to them.  If Alice sees two red hats, she would immediately know her hat is blue (since there's at least one red hat). Since she doesn't know, at least one of the hats Bob and Carla are wearing must be blue.\n\n**Step 3: Extending Negative Reasoning to Bob (WHY)**\n\nBob hears Alice's statement. He knows that if he sees two red hats, his must be blue.  Since he also says \"I don't know,\" this means that Carla's hat cannot be red *if* Bob's is red. In other words, if Bob sees a red hat on Alice and doesn't know his own hat color, Carla's must be blue.\n\n**Step 4: Carla's Deduction (WHEN)**\n\nCarla hears both Alice and Bob say \"I don't know.\"  Applying the logic from steps 2 and 3, Carla reasons as follows:\n* If my hat were blue, Alice would have seen two blue hats (Bob and Carla) and known hers was red.\n* Since Alice didn't know, at least one of Bob's or my hat is red.\n* If Bob saw Alice with a red hat, and me with a blue hat, he would know his hat was red (since at least one must be red).\n* Since Bob *also* didn't know, my hat cannot be blue.\n* Therefore, my hat must be red.\n\n**Steps 5-7 (WHERE, WHO, WHICH):** These steps are less directly applicable to the core logical deduction.  The \"where\" is a hypothetical scenario. The \"who\" is defined in the problem statement. The \"which\" involves choosing between possible hat color combinations, which is implicitly covered in the logical deduction.\n\n\n## WHY: Justification\n\nThe solution is justified by principles of deductive logic and negative reasoning. We systematically eliminate possibilities based on the knowledge and statements of each participant. The core principle is that if someone *doesn't* know something, it provides information about what they *can* see.\n\n## WHEN: Applicability\n\nThis solution applies to scenarios involving perfect logicians with complete knowledge of the rules and the ability to make flawless deductions. It also requires the specific constraint of at least one red hat.\n\n## WHERE: Validity\n\nThis solution is valid within the confines of the stated problem. It relies on the perfect rationality of the participants and the clearly defined rules of the game.\n\n## WHO: Entities\n\nThe entities involved are Alice, Bob, and Carla (the logicians), and the game master who sets the rules and provides the initial information.\n\n## WHICH: Alternatives\n\nThere are no alternative solutions that satisfy all the constraints and statements of the problem. The logical deduction leads to a unique solution.\n\n## HIDDEN INSIGHTS\n\nThe key insight is the power of negative reasoning.  By focusing on what *cannot* be true, we deduce what *must* be true.\n\n## FINAL ANSWER\n\nAlice: Blue\nBob: Blue\nCarla: Red\n\nConfidence: 1.0\n",
