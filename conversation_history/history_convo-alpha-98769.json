    "answer": "## WHAT: Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem asks us to identify General Purpose AI (GPAI) models that pose systemic risks according to the EU AI Act.  This requires understanding the definition of GPAI, the concept of systemic risk in the context of AI, and the specific criteria outlined in the EU AI Act that classify certain AI systems as high-risk, including those posing systemic risks.\n\n## HOW: Solution Process\n\n* **Step 1: Define GPAI and Systemic Risk (What)**\n    * **Action:** Define the core concepts based on the EU AI Act and related literature.\n    * **Inner Reasoning:**  GPAI models are AI systems with broad applicability across various domains, not designed for a specific purpose. Systemic risk refers to the potential for widespread negative consequences across interconnected systems due to the failure or misuse of a GPAI model.\n    * **Output:** Clear definitions of GPAI and systemic risk.\n\n* **Step 2: Identify Relevant Articles in the EU AI Act (How)**\n    * **Action:** Analyze the EU AI Act to pinpoint articles related to high-risk AI systems and systemic risk.\n    * **Inner Reasoning:** The Act categorizes AI systems based on their intended purpose and potential impact.  We need to identify the articles that define criteria for high-risk systems, particularly those related to systemic risk.\n    * **Output:** List of relevant articles (e.g., Articles 6, 7, and Annex III).\n\n* **Step 3: Analyze Criteria for Systemic Risk (Why)**\n    * **Action:**  Examine the specific criteria within the identified articles that relate to systemic risk.\n    * **Inner Reasoning:** The Act likely considers factors such as the scale of deployment, the criticality of the infrastructure affected, and the potential for cascading failures.\n    * **Output:**  Specific criteria for systemic risk from the EU AI Act.\n\n* **Step 4: Apply Criteria to GPAI Models (Validate)**\n    * **Action:** Consider examples of GPAI models and assess whether they meet the criteria for systemic risk.\n    * **Inner Reasoning:** This involves evaluating the potential impact of these models on various sectors and their interconnectedness.\n    * **Output:** Examples of GPAI models that potentially pose systemic risks.\n\n* **Step 5: Consider Future Developments (When)**\n    * **Action:** Acknowledge that the landscape of GPAI is rapidly evolving.\n    * **Inner Reasoning:** New GPAI models and applications may emerge that pose systemic risks not currently foreseen.\n    * **Output:**  Understanding of the dynamic nature of systemic risk in AI.\n\n* **Step 6: Scope and Limitations (Where)**\n    * **Action:** Define the boundaries of the analysis.\n    * **Inner Reasoning:**  The analysis is limited to the current understanding of GPAI and the EU AI Act.  It may not capture all potential future risks.\n    * **Output:** Clear statement of the scope and limitations.\n\n* **Step 7: Stakeholders (Who)**\n    * **Action:** Identify the key stakeholders involved in the development, deployment, and regulation of GPAI.\n    * **Inner Reasoning:** This includes developers, users, regulators, and the public.\n    * **Output:** List of key stakeholders.\n\n* **Step 8: Alternative Approaches to Risk Mitigation (Which)**\n    * **Action:** Explore alternative approaches to mitigating systemic risks from GPAI.\n    * **Inner Reasoning:** This could include stricter regulations, technical safeguards, and international cooperation.\n    * **Output:**  Discussion of alternative risk mitigation strategies.\n\n\n## WHY: Justification\n\nThe justification for this approach is based on the legal framework of the EU AI Act, which aims to regulate high-risk AI systems, including those posing systemic risks.  The logical structure follows a deductive approach, starting with the definitions and criteria from the Act and applying them to GPAI models.\n\n## WHEN: Applicability\n\nThis analysis applies to the current version of the EU AI Act and the current understanding of GPAI.  It will need to be updated as the technology and regulatory landscape evolve.\n\n## WHERE: Validity\n\nThis analysis is valid within the European Union, as the EU AI Act is the relevant legal framework.  However, the concepts of GPAI and systemic risk are relevant globally, and other jurisdictions may adopt similar regulations.\n\n## WHO: Entities\n\nThe entities involved include:\n* **EU policymakers:** Responsible for drafting and implementing the AI Act.\n* **GPAI developers:**  Responsible for designing and building these models.\n* **Businesses and organizations:**  Deploying GPAI models in various applications.\n* **Citizens:**  Potentially affected by the deployment of GPAI.\n\n## WHICH: Alternatives\n\nAlternative approaches to addressing systemic risk could include:\n* **Self-regulation:**  Industry-led initiatives to develop and implement safety standards.\n* **International cooperation:**  Harmonizing regulations and standards across countries.\n* **Focusing on specific applications:**  Regulating specific high-risk applications of GPAI rather than GPAI itself.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the EU AI Act as the primary framework for addressing systemic risk.\n\n## HIDDEN INSIGHTS\n\nA key insight is the difficulty in precisely defining and anticipating systemic risks from GPAI due to the emergent nature of complex systems.  The interconnectedness of various sectors makes it challenging to predict the cascading effects of AI failures.\n\n## FINAL ANSWER\n\nThe EU AI Act does not explicitly define \"General Purpose AI\" but addresses systems that pose systemic risks.  Foundation models, which often underpin GPAI, can be considered high-risk if they are used in high-risk areas listed in Annex III (e.g., critical infrastructure, law enforcement, border control) or if their use creates a similar level of risk.  The specific GPAI models that pose systemic risks will depend on their application and scale of deployment, as assessed against the criteria in the AI Act. Confidence: 0.85.  This confidence level reflects the evolving nature of both GPAI and the regulatory landscape.\n",

    "answer": "The EU AI Act doesn't explicitly categorize AI models as \"General Purpose\" but focuses on their *use case* and potential for harm.  Foundation models, the building blocks of many General Purpose AI systems, can be deemed high-risk if deployed in sensitive areas like critical infrastructure, law enforcement, or border control (as listed in Annex III), or if their use creates comparable risks.\n\nKey takeaway:  It's not the *model* itself, but *how it's used* that determines its risk level under the EU AI Act.  Factors like scale of deployment and potential impact are crucial for assessing systemic risk.\n\nTherefore,  specific General Purpose AI systems posing systemic risks will depend on their application and how widely they're used, measured against the EU AI Act's criteria.  It's important to remember that this is a developing area, and both the technology and regulations are subject to change.\n",
